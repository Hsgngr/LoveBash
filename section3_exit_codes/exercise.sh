#Udemy Course Section 3: Exit Codes Exercises

#Exercise 1:
#Write a shell script that displays "This script will exit with a 0 exit status."
#Be sure that the script does indeed exit with a 0 exit status.

echo "This script will  exit with a 0 exit status"
echo $?

#Exercise 2:
#Write a shell script that accepts a file or directory name as an argument.
#Have the script report if it is a regular file, a directory, or other type of file.
#If it is a regular file, exit with a 0 exit status. 
#If it is a directory, exit with a 1 exit status. 
#If it is some other type of file, exit with a 2 exit status.

if [ $# -ne 0 ]; then

    for FILE in $@
    do
        if [ -d "$FILE" ]
        then
            echo "${FILE} is a directory."
            exit 1
        elif [ -f "$FILE" ]
        then
            echo " ${FILE} is a regular file."
            exit 0
        elif [ -e "$FILE" ]
        then
            echo " ${FILE} is a file any other type than regular."
            exit 2
        else
            echo " ${FILE} does not exist."
            exit 2
        fi
    done
fi


#Exercise 3:

#Write a script that executes the command "cat /etc/shadow". ,
#If the command returns a 0 exit status report "Command succeeded" and exit with a 0 exit status. 
#If the command returns a nonÂ­zero exit status report "Command failed" and exit with a 1 exit status.

cat /etc/shadow

if [ "$?" -eq "0" ]
then
    echo "Command succeeded"
else
    echo "Command failed."
    exit 1
fi
